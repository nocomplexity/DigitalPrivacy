Everyone can and should help to raise awareness on digital privacy issues when using new internet technology. 



Assume that all governmental organisations do their best to benefit from using technology to better serve you.

However, many governmental  organisations and commercial businesses have not enough awareness on digital privacy issues. Most organisations lack proper expertise and knowledge on privacy issues when applying new technology based services. So help to raise awareness and promote solid open transparent privacy friendly tools. Both hardware and software!
