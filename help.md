Everyone can and should help to raise awareness on digital privacy issues when using new internet technology. 

Assume that all governmental organisations do their best to benefit from using technology to better serve you.  However, too many governmental  organisations and commercial businesses have little to no awareness on digital privacy issues. Most lack proper expertise and knowledge on privacy issues that are introduced when using new technology. But the truth is some organisations also are brainwashed by their commercial vendors who often have contractual make use and misuse data collected by their solution for free.
