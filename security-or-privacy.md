# No Security no privacy

Security and privacy are distinct topics, but they are also closely related. The difference between the two and how they relate is crucial for both security professionals and digital privacy fighters:

* Security is the act of keeping private data and systems protected against unauthorised access. This includes both company (internal) data and user and partner (external) data.

+++

* Privacy refers to the act of giving users the right to control how their data is collected, stored, and used, and not using it irresponsibly. For example, you should clearly communicate to users of your sites the data you are collecting, with whom it will be shared, and how it will be used. Users must be given a chance to consent to your privacy policy, have access to their data you have stored, and delete their data if they no longer wish you to have it.
