# Why

:::{danger} 
Without security, no privacy.

It is simple. Keep it simple. Mitigating digital security risks is not simple. So use **GOOD** the [Open Security Architecture](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/securityarchitecture/introduction.html) to find simple solutions for complex challenges.

Technology alone will never solve a single problem, but bad technical solutions do make it very hard.

Despite the privacy procedures, handbooks and process audits: Bad solutions make good procedures worthless.

The reasons to only accept FOSS technical solutions for protecting privacy related data are simple:
* Open source(FOSS) is the antidote to surveillance capitalism.
* FOSS software solutions are open and transparent.
* FOSS solutions are easier to verify to see if it does what the creators say that it does.

:::{tip}
For FOSS privacy solutions the used FOSS license matters.
