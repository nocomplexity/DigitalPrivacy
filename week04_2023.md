## Hacking News

### Hyundai Head Unit Hacking

I love hacking stories like this. Software in modern cars is vulnerable. But the real bad news is that cyber risks will impact your safety. The risks on software security breaches is mostly low , but the impact is not nice when you are the test dummy in a hacked car. So do not jail break your car software if you are not really sure what you do.

### SaaS should not be the default: Why data breaches signal return to self-hosting

Depending on your age and experience in the industry, the prospect of self-hosted software returning can range from plausible to laughable. The instinct to doubt makes sense â€“ SaaS became the dominant model of software delivery for a variety of valid reasons. But after years of as I call it outsourcing to a black box environment more and more security breaches have been exposed.The big barrier for Cloud hosting was always having uncontrolled security risks and concerns. So is now in 2023 self-hosted software making a comeback? The fairy tale that Saas or Cloud security is always better from a security perspective is and was simple never true.

## Security Research 

### Three Lessons from Threema - Analysis of a Secure Messenger

Most people assume messaging is private and secure. Threema is a Swiss encrypted messaging application. It has more than 10 million users and more than 7000 on-premise customers. It is also used heavily by governments. This research is a must read to keep you focused on vulnerabilities when using encryption. Excellent paper and presented in a nice to read html way too!

### On business adoption and use of reproducible builds for open and closed source software

Reproducible builds (R-Bs) are software engineering practices that reliably create bit-for-
bit identical binary executable files from specified source code. There are good engineering reasons to use R-Bs in industrial software development, and the principle of establishing correspondence between
source code and binary offers opportunities for the development of further applications.
This research paper is a well-documented and insightful read.

This article describes an interview study that focuses on the adoption and uses of of R-Bs in industry - with examples, and some pros and cons. 

 Of course all information on R-Bs can be found in our [Security Reference Architecture](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/securityarchitecture/prevention/reproduciblebuilds.html).

## Security Conferences

Security conferences are a great way to learn and network with like minded hackers. 
I love  security conferences that practice openness. So conferences that promote openness as basic value for security knowledge sharing. Think of open science, open data, open access proceedings  and open research with FOSS code. Great open security conferences publish presentations in an open access format so we can all learn and enjoy. 



### FOSDEM 2023


Location | When                | Link
---------|---------------------|-----------
Brussels | 4 & 5 February 2023 | [(Link)](https://fosdem.org/2023/)

FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. A lot of talks can be found in the [Security Devroom](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/security/), but also great security talks will be held on the main tracks. I am a fan of FOSDEM since it the the place to meet all relevant FOSS developers who come to Brussels to share their work. But note Fosdem is not a polished conference so you love it or you escape and never come back. 




## Vulnerabilities and Exposures

Knowledge of cyber security threads make your cyber security defense better. New vulnerabilities are published on a daily basis. This section gives a short opinionated selection of vulnerabilities to improve your awareness and knowledge. 

### CVE-2023-22809: Sudoedit can edit arbitrary files

Sudo allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the
ability to run some (or all) commands on various unix systems. So check if you need to take action regarding this detected vulnerability. Most solid ux distributions will update your sudo package whenever you apply an update of course.
